# Verilog-Alarm-Clock
A verilog file creating an alarm clock that sets a timer and runs time. 
The module is ported to an FPGA board that sets the alarm using a series 
of buttons and displays the time on a 7 segment LED Display.
In the source files is a PDF of a a demonstration of the clock.
It shows waveforms as well as the FPGA board setting an alarm at 7:22. 
 Setting the time of the clock to run at 7:21 and the alarm going off at 7:22.
Displayed by a series of LEDs above the switches. 
With another photo to turn the alarm off
